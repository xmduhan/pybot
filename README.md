# pybot
A UI automation tool implemented using a multimodal model.

This project is inspired by: https://github.com/bytebot-ai/bytebot, but I prefer to use Python for backend development and API calls, and I aim to simplify the project to improve its usability.

## Features
- UI automation using multimodal models
- Python backend and Web UI for config
- Easy-to-use API calls

## Installation
